# Anthropic Cookbook for Bedrock Users

The Anthropic Cookbook for Bedrock Users provides code and guides designed to help developers build with Claude 3 on AWS Bedrock, providing copy-able code snippets that you can easily integrate into your own projects.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of the examples in this cookbook, you'll NOT need an Anthropic API key, but access to AWS Bedrock Claude 3 model.

While the code examples are primarily written in Python, the concepts can be adapted to any programming language that supports interaction with the Anthropic API.
